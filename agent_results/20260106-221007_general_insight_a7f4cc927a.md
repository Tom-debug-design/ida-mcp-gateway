1) Verdict: Ready to plan concrete repo actions for global finance/arbitrage intelligence engines.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three revenue engines: (1) news scraping/alert service, (2) arbitrage signal API, (3) premium analytics dashboard.
- Set up ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to document all automated runs and outputs.
- Implement global news/finance data collectors in src/collectors/news/ and src/collectors/finance/.
- Build arbitrage opportunity scanner in src/engines/arbitrage_scanner.py using cross-market price feeds.
- Develop minimal MVP for news alerting (lowest effort) in src/engines/news_alerts.py.
- Add config/templates for new data sources in config/data_sources.yaml.
- Integrate basic revenue tracking in src/ops/revenue_log.py.
- Prepare README sections for each revenue engine in docs/README.md.
- Set up test cases for each engine in tests/engines/.
- Document all repo actions and decisions in agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md.
