1) ROI_SCAN plan: Focus on low-effort, parallel revenue engines in global finance/news intelligence.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining 3 revenue engines: (1) news data reselling, (2) arbitrage signal alerts, (3) premium analytics API.
- Log all actions and findings in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md for traceability.
- For news data reselling: Identify and list global news sources (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg, regional feeds) in a sources/news_sources.md file.
- For arbitrage signal alerts: Build a scripts/arbitrage_scanner.py to scan price differences across global markets (crypto, FX, equities).
- For premium analytics API: Draft api/analytics_api_spec.md with endpoints for finance/news intelligence.
- Prioritize lowest-effort engine (news data reselling) for MVP; document required data pipelines in pipelines/news_pipeline.md.
- Set up config/markets.yaml to define target markets and asset classes for arbitrage scanning.
- Document revenue model assumptions and pricing in agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md.
- Ensure all repo actions are concrete file creations or edits, not just conceptual.
- No claims of execution; only plan and file structure.
