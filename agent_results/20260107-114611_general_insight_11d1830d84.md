1) Verdict: Ready to plan concrete repo actions for global finance/news arbitrage engines with three low-effort revenue streams.

2) Actionable Insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three parallel revenue engines: (1) news signal resale, (2) arbitrage alerts, (3) premium data dashboards.
- Set up ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to track all automation and agent actions.
- Implement a pipeline in /pipelines/news_intel/ to aggregate and normalize global finance/news feeds (not just social media).
- Build /modules/arbitrage_scanner/ for scanning cross-market price discrepancies.
- Add /modules/signal_resale/ for packaging and distributing actionable news signals to clients.
- Establish /dashboards/finance_insights/ for premium, subscription-based analytics.
- Integrate logging in all modules to ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md.
- Prioritize low-effort engines: start with signal resale (data packaging), then arbitrage alerts (automated notifications), then dashboards (UI/UX).
- Document all data sources and endpoints in /docs/data_sources.md.
- Ensure all repo actions are tracked with commit SHAs and links for future audit.

- Latency and reliability of arbitrage detection across markets.
- Legal/regulatory constraints on signal resale and arbitrage alerts.
- Market demand for each revenue engine.
- Technical integration challenges between modules.
