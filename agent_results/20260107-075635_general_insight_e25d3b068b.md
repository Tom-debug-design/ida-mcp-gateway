1) Verdict: Ready to scan for low-effort, parallel revenue engines in global markets/news arbitrage.

2) Bullet insights:
- Identify and monitor global financial news APIs (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters) for arbitrage signals.
- Build a lightweight Python script in src/engines/arbitrage_news.py to parse and flag actionable news events.
- Create config/news_sources.yaml to manage and update news/intel feeds.
- Set up src/engines/arbitrage_social.py for social sentiment as a secondary signal (not primary).
- Add src/engines/arbitrage_fx.py for FX rate discrepancies across markets.
- Log all engine outputs to data/arbitrage_signals/YYYYMMDD.csv for later analysis.
- Document the plan and logic in agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md.
- Track all automated runs and errors in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md.
- Prioritize engines by setup complexity: news parsing, FX arbitrage, then social sentiment.

4) Risks/unknowns:
- API access/costs for premium news feeds.
- Latency and reliability of news/intel sources.
- Legal/regulatory risks in arbitrage activities.
- Signal-to-noise ratio in news-driven arbitrage.
- FX market data coverage and update frequency.
