1) Verdict: ROI_SCAN requires concrete repo actions for global market arbitrage and finance intelligence engines.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three parallel revenue engines, prioritizing lowest effort.
- Log all planned actions and rationale in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md for traceability.
- Set up a /data/feeds/ directory for global market and financial news data sources (not just social media).
- Implement scripts in /engines/arbitrage/ to scan for cross-market price discrepancies (crypto, forex, equities).
- Build /engines/news_intel/ to aggregate and analyze finance/news feeds for actionable intelligence.
- Add /engines/alerts/ for low-effort, automated signal generation (e.g., price spikes, news sentiment).
- Document all data sources and engine logic in /docs/ENGINE_OVERVIEW.md.
- Use config files in /config/ for modularity (e.g., /config/feeds.yaml, /config/arbitrage.yaml).
- Ensure all actions are logged in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md with timestamps and outcomes.
