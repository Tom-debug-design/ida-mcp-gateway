1) Verdict: Concrete repo actions identified for global finance intelligence and arbitrage ROI plan.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three revenue engines: (1) news scraping arbitrage, (2) global market signal aggregation, (3) finance data API resale.
- Add ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to document all automated runs and outputs for traceability.
- Implement scripts in /engines/arbitrage/news_scraper.py for low-effort news-driven arbitrage signals.
- Build /engines/market_aggregator/global_signals.py to aggregate and normalize global market data.
- Set up /engines/data_resale/finance_api_proxy.py for packaging and reselling curated finance data streams.
- Integrate /configs/markets.yaml to define target markets, news sources, and arbitrage parameters.
- Add /tests/arbitrage/test_news_scraper.py to validate news arbitrage extraction logic.
- Document all engine usage and revenue tracking in /docs/REVENUE_ENGINES.md.
- Schedule daily runs via /ops/schedules/autorun_cron.yaml for continuous intelligence and arbitrage.
- Log all external data fetches in /ops/logs/DATA_FETCH_LOG.md for compliance and auditing.
