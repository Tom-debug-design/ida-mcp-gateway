1) Verdict: Ready to plan concrete repo actions for global arbitrage/news-finance intelligence engines with 3 low-effort revenue streams.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining 3 parallel revenue engines: (1) curated news/finance data feeds, (2) arbitrage signal alerts, (3) premium analytics API.
- Set up ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to track all automated runs, data pulls, and engine outputs.
- Implement global news/finance data ingestion in src/feeds/ (e.g., src/feeds/news.py, src/feeds/markets.py).
- Build arbitrage signal engine in src/arbitrage/ (e.g., src/arbitrage/signals.py) using cross-market price data.
- Develop intelligence engine in src/intel/ (e.g., src/intel/engine.py) to aggregate, score, and summarize actionable news.
- Add revenue engine 1: auto-curated daily/weekly reports in outputs/reports/ for subscribers.
- Add revenue engine 2: real-time arbitrage alerts (outputs/alerts/), delivered via webhook/email.
- Add revenue engine 3: premium API endpoints in src/api/ (e.g., src/api/analytics.py) for advanced analytics access.
- Document all endpoints, data sources, and revenue flows in agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md.
- Log all automated actions, errors, and revenue events in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md.

4) Risks/unknowns:
- Data source licensing/costs and API rate limits may restrict ingestion.
- Real-time arbitrage detection accuracy and latency.
- Market demand for each revenue engine is unvalidated.
- Compliance and regulatory risks in certain jurisdictions.
- Technical integration complexity across global markets.
