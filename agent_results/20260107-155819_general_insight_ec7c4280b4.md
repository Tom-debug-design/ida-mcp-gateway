1) Verdict: Concrete repo actions identified for global finance/arbitrage intelligence engines with 3 revenue streams.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three revenue engines: (1) news-driven arbitrage alerts, (2) global market data API resale, (3) premium finance intelligence reports.
- Log all repo actions and findings in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md for traceability.
- Implement news/finance data ingestion pipeline (e.g., scripts/news_ingest.py, data/raw_news/).
- Build arbitrage signal generator (e.g., engines/arbitrage_signals.py) using ingested global market data.
- Set up API endpoints for market data resale (e.g., api/marketdata.py).
- Draft templates for premium reports (templates/report_template.md, reports/sample_report.md).
- Integrate basic dashboard for alert delivery (web/dashboard.py).
- Prioritize low-effort revenue engine (API resale) for MVP.
- Document all data sources and licensing in docs/data_sources.md.
- Schedule regular intelligence scans (scripts/scheduler.py) for continuous opportunity detection.

4) Risks/unknowns:
- Data source licensing and API rate limits may restrict usage/resale.
- Real-time global market coverage may require costly feeds.
- Arbitrage signals may have high false positive rates without advanced filtering.
- Regulatory compliance for financial data resale is unclear.
- Market demand for premium reports needs validation.
