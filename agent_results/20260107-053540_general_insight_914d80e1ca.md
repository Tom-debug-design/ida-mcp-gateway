1) Verdict: Ready to plan concrete repo actions for global finance/arbitrage intelligence with three parallel revenue engines.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three revenue engines: (1) news/finance data aggregation, (2) arbitrage signal alerts, (3) premium analytics API.
- Log all planning and execution steps in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md for traceability.
- Set up data ingestion scripts in data/feeds/ for global news, financial reports, and market data (not just social media).
- Implement arbitrage opportunity scanner in engines/arbitrage_scanner.py, focusing on low-effort, high-frequency signals (e.g., FX, crypto spreads).
- Build a basic web dashboard in ui/dashboard/ to display real-time signals and analytics.
- Develop a subscription/paywall module in services/paywall.py to monetize premium analytics.
- Integrate alert delivery (email, webhook) in services/alerts.py for paid users.
- Document all APIs and data sources in docs/DATA_SOURCES.md for compliance and scaling.
- Prioritize automation and minimal manual intervention in all scripts and workflows.
