1) Verdict: Ready to plan concrete repo actions for global finance/arbitrage intelligence engines.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining 3 parallel revenue engines: (1) news scraping for arbitrage signals, (2) global market data aggregation, (3) finance intelligence API.
- Set up ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to track all automated runs and outputs.
- Implement lowest-effort engine first: news/finance RSS/HTML scraper targeting arbitrage keywords, outputting signals to /data/arbitrage_signals.json.
- Build modular pipeline in /engines/news_arbitrage/ for ingest, parse, deduplicate, and signal extraction.
- Add /engines/market_data/ for global exchange rates, commodities, and cross-market spreads.
- Develop /engines/intel_api/ to expose signals and aggregated data via REST endpoints.
- Integrate logging in /ops/logs/ for each engine’s run, errors, and ROI metrics.
- Document all endpoints, data flows, and revenue logic in /docs/REVENUE_ENGINES.md.
- Schedule regular scans (cron or workflow) in /ops/schedules/ for each engine.
- Prioritize open-source, low-maintenance data sources and libraries for minimal upkeep.

4) Risks/unknowns:
- Availability and reliability of free/low-cost global finance/news data sources.
- Legal/compliance issues with data scraping and redistribution.
- Realistic ROI and market demand for arbitrage signals.
- Maintenance effort for keeping data pipelines robust.
- API rate limits and potential blocking by data providers.
