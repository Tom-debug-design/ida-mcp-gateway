1) Verdict: Ready to plan concrete repo actions for global arbitrage/news-finance intelligence engines.

2) Actionable Insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three parallel revenue engines: (1) news scraping arbitrage, (2) global market signal alerts, (3) finance data resale.
- Set up ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to document all automated runs and outcomes.
- Implement /engines/arbitrage_news_scraper.py to aggregate global news for arbitrage signals.
- Build /engines/market_signal_alerts.py to monitor cross-market price discrepancies.
- Develop /engines/data_resale_api.py for packaging and selling processed finance/news data.
- Integrate /configs/global_markets.yaml listing target exchanges, news sources, and arbitrage pairs.
- Add /tests/arbitrage_news_scraper_test.py for validation of news-to-signal pipeline.
- Automate daily runs via /ops/autorun.sh and log outputs in AUTORUN_LOG.md.
- Prioritize lowest-effort engine (news scraping arbitrage) for earliest deployment.
- Document revenue models and operational steps in ROI_PLAN.md for each engine.
