1) Verdict: ROI scan requires concrete repo actions for global finance intelligence and arbitrage revenue engines.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three parallel revenue engines, prioritizing lowest effort.
- Draft ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to document all automation and intelligence-gathering runs.
- Set up data ingestion scripts in /data/feeds/ for global financial news, market APIs, and arbitrage signals.
- Implement /engines/arbitrage/ for scanning cross-market price discrepancies (crypto, FX, equities).
- Build /engines/news_intel/ for parsing and ranking actionable finance news (not limited to social media).
- Add /engines/alerts/ for real-time notification of arbitrage or news-driven opportunities.
- Integrate config files in /config/ for API keys, market selection, and engine toggles.
- Document all repo actions and engine logic in /docs/ENGINE_OVERVIEW.md.
- Schedule regular runs via /ops/scheduler.yaml for continuous intelligence and opportunity scanning.

4) Risks/unknowns:
- Data source reliability and API access limits are unverified.
- Revenue engine feasibility depends on real-time data quality.
- Legal/regulatory risks for arbitrage activities in some markets.
- No current evidence of implemented repo actions—requires follow-up.
