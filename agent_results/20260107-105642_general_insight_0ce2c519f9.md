1) Verdict: Ready to design concrete repo actions for global finance/arbitrage intelligence engines.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three parallel revenue engines, prioritizing lowest effort.
- Set up ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to track all automated scans and intelligence pulls.
- Implement scripts in /engines/arbitrage/ for scraping global market price data (e.g., stocks, commodities, FX).
- Build /engines/news_intel/ pipeline for ingesting and parsing finance/news feeds (RSS, APIs, web scraping).
- Add /engines/arbitrage/arbitrage_opportunities.py to detect price mismatches across exchanges/markets.
- Develop /engines/news_intel/signal_extractor.py to extract actionable signals from news (not just social media).
- Document all data sources and endpoints in /docs/data_sources.md for transparency and reproducibility.
- Set up /engines/low_effort/quick_alerts.py for simple, high-frequency arbitrage or news-based alerts.
- Ensure all scripts log to ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md for traceability and debugging.

4) Risks/unknowns:
- Access limitations or costs for real-time global market data.
- Legal/compliance risks in scraping or using certain data sources.
- Reliability and latency of news/finance feeds.
- Difficulty in extracting actionable signals from non-social media sources.
- Potential for false positives in arbitrage detection.
