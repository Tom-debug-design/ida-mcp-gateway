1) Verdict: ROI_SCAN plan requires concrete repo actions for global markets intelligence and arbitrage revenue engines.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining 3 parallel revenue engines (lowest effort first) for global finance/news intelligence.
- Draft ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to log all automated scans and intelligence pulls.
- Implement /engines/arbitrage_scanner.py to scan for global market price discrepancies (crypto, FX, equities).
- Add /engines/news_intel_collector.py to aggregate financial news from APIs (Reuters, Bloomberg, etc.).
- Build /engines/alert_dispatcher.py to push actionable arbitrage/news signals to users.
- Set up /configs/markets.yaml to define target markets, news sources, and arbitrage pairs.
- Add /data/feeds/ directory for raw news and market data dumps.
- Integrate /tests/test_arbitrage_scanner.py for basic validation of arbitrage logic.
- Document engine workflows in /docs/ENGINE_OVERVIEW.md.
- Ensure all scripts log to /ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md for traceability.

4) Risks/unknowns:
- Access to premium financial news APIs may require licensing or fees.
- Real-time global market data feeds may have latency or cost barriers.
- Legal/compliance risks in executing arbitrage across jurisdictions.
- Uncertainty in user demand for specific intelligence outputs.
- Technical integration challenges between engines and data sources.
