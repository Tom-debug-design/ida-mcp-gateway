1) Verdict: ROI scan requires concrete repo actions for global finance intelligence and arbitrage revenue engines.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three revenue engines: data reselling, signal subscriptions, and arbitrage execution.
- Log all steps and findings in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md for traceability.
- Implement data ingestion scripts in data/feeds/ for global news and financial APIs (not just social media).
- Build initial arbitrage opportunity scanner in engines/arbitrage_scanner.py using cross-market price feeds.
- Set up signal generation pipeline in engines/signal_engine.py for actionable finance/news intelligence.
- Add config files in config/markets.yaml to define target markets and data sources.
- Document all revenue engine logic and dependencies in docs/REVENUE_ENGINES.md.
- Prioritize lowest-effort revenue engine (data reselling) for MVP.
- Prepare scripts in scripts/ for automated data extraction and reporting.
- Ensure all code and logs are versioned and referenced by SHA in future claims.

- Real-time data latency and reliability.
- Regulatory/compliance issues for arbitrage and data reselling.
- Market depth and actual arbitrage feasibility.
- Scalability of signal generation and delivery.
