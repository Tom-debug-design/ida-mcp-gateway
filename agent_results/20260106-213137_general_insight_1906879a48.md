1) ROI_SCAN plan: Concrete repo actions to launch 3 revenue engines in global finance intelligence.

- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining 3 revenue engines: (1) News scraping + signal resale, (2) Arbitrage alert API, (3) Custom analytics dashboard.
- Add ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to track all automated runs, data pulls, and revenue events.
- Implement /src/feeds/news_scraper.py for multi-source global finance/news ingestion (Reuters, Bloomberg, regional feeds).
- Build /src/engines/arbitrage_detector.py to scan cross-market price feeds (crypto, FX, equities) for actionable arbitrage.
- Set up /src/api/signal_resale.py to expose news-derived signals via REST API (lowest effort, first revenue).
- Add /src/ops/market_config.yaml to define global markets, asset pairs, and news sources.
- Write /src/analytics/dashboard.py for custom client dashboards (highest effort, third engine).
- Document all endpoints, data flows, and revenue logic in /docs/REVENUE_ENGINES.md.
- Schedule daily/weekly runs in /ops/schedules/cron_jobs.txt for each engine.
- Log all revenue events and arbitrage hits in /data/logs/revenue_events.csv.

- Latency and reliability of real-time price feeds.
- Legal/compliance issues with signal resale/arbitrage.
- Market demand for each revenue engine.
- Data normalization challenges across regions and asset classes.
