1) ROI scan plan requires concrete repo actions for global markets/finance intelligence and 3 revenue engines.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three parallel revenue engines: data resale, signal subscriptions, and arbitrage execution.
- Log all repo actions and findings in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md for traceability.
- Implement global market data ingestion in /data/feeds/global_markets/ (e.g., scripts for equities, FX, commodities).
- Build news/finance intelligence engine in /engines/news_intel/ (focus on newswire, regulatory filings, not just social).
- Set up arbitrage opportunity scanner in /engines/arbitrage_scan/ (cross-market price comparison).
- Develop low-effort revenue engine: curated data resale via /products/data_exports/.
- Medium-effort: signal subscription service in /products/signal_subscriptions/ (API + dashboard).
- High-effort: automated arbitrage execution in /products/arbitrage_exec/ (requires compliance checks).
- Document all revenue engine logic and market focus in agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md.
- Ensure all scripts and modules are versioned and paths are logged in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md.

- Regulatory/compliance requirements for arbitrage execution.
- Market demand for data resale and signal subscriptions.
- Technical feasibility of real-time arbitrage across markets.
- Integration complexity for news/finance intelligence beyond social media.
