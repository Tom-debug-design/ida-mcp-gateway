1) Verdict: ROI_SCAN plan requires concrete repo actions for global finance intelligence and arbitrage revenue engines.

2) Actionable Insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three revenue engines: (1) news scraping arbitrage, (2) global market signal aggregation, (3) finance data API resale.
- Log all repo actions in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md for traceability.
- Implement a /data/news_sources/ directory to store curated global news and finance feeds (not just social media).
- Add /engines/arbitrage/ for scripts identifying cross-market price discrepancies.
- Build /engines/signal_aggregator/ for ingesting and normalizing global market signals.
- Set up /engines/api_resale/ for wrapping and reselling finance/news APIs.
- Prioritize lowest effort: start with API resale, then signal aggregation, then arbitrage engine.
- Document all external data sources and licensing in /docs/DATA_SOURCES.md.
- Add a /tests/ directory for validating engine outputs and ROI assumptions.
- Schedule regular updates to ROI_PLAN.md based on engine performance metrics.

4) Risks/unknowns:
- Licensing and legal compliance of external news/finance data sources.
- Real-time data access and API rate limits.
- Market volatility affecting arbitrage ROI.
- Technical feasibility of signal normalization across diverse markets.
- Demand and pricing for API resale.
