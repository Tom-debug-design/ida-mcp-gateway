1) Verdict: Ready to scan repos for global arbitrage/news intelligence, plan 3 revenue engines, and log actions.

2) Bullet insights:
- Identify existing repo files related to global markets, arbitrage, and news/finance data ingestion (e.g., /data_sources/, /pipelines/).
- Scan for modules or scripts that aggregate financial news beyond social media (e.g., /news_crawlers/, /feeds/).
- Locate any arbitrage strategy scripts or notebooks (e.g., /strategies/arbitrage/, /notebooks/arbitrage_*.ipynb).
- Check for config files listing data sources/APIs (e.g., config/data_sources.yaml, .env).
- Find any revenue-related modules (e.g., /monetization/, /billing/, /api_pricing/).
- Prioritize lowest-effort revenue engines: affiliate links, data API access, and premium analytics dashboards.
- Document all findings and planned actions in agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md.
- Log all repo scan actions and findings in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md.
- Ensure all actions are repo-specific, not conceptual.

4) Risks/unknowns:
- Repo structure may not match expected patterns; some modules may be undocumented or hidden.
- Data source/API credentials may be missing or outdated.
- Revenue engine code may be incomplete or only partially implemented.
- Some intelligence components may rely on external, inaccessible services.
