1) Verdict: Concrete repo actions identified for rapid ROI in global finance/news intelligence.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three revenue engines: data resale, signal alerts, and API access.
- Log all repo actions and findings in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md for traceability.
- Implement data pipeline scripts in /pipelines/ for global news/finance aggregation (not just social).
- Add /arbitrage/engine.py to scan for cross-market price discrepancies.
- Build /signals/alert_service.py to deliver actionable finance/news alerts.
- Document API endpoints in /api/README.md for third-party access.
- Prioritize resale of aggregated datasets (lowest effort, fastest revenue).
- Set up /market_feeds/ for ingesting global market data (e.g., equities, FX, commodities).
- Integrate news sources beyond social media in /sources/news_feeds.yaml.
- Add /tests/coverage_arbitrage.py to validate arbitrage engine accuracy.
