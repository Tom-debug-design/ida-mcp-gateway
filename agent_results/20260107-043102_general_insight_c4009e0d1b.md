1) Verdict: Concrete repo actions planned for global market arbitrage and finance intelligence revenue engines.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three revenue engines: (1) news arbitrage alerts, (2) global market data scraping, (3) finance intelligence API.
- Add ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to track all automated runs and outcomes.
- Implement scripts in /engines/arbitrage_alerts/ for parsing and alerting on cross-market price discrepancies.
- Build /engines/market_scraper/ for automated collection of global financial news and market data.
- Develop /engines/intel_api/ to expose processed intelligence as an API for clients.
- Prioritize low-effort: start with news arbitrage alerts using existing RSS/news APIs.
- Integrate logging in all engines to ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md for traceability.
- Ensure all data sources and endpoints are configurable via /config/market_sources.yaml.
- Document setup and usage in /docs/REVENUE_ENGINES.md.
- Schedule regular scans for new arbitrage opportunities and log results.

- Legal/compliance issues with data scraping and arbitrage activities.
- Market latency and data freshness impacting arbitrage viability.
- Monetization feasibility for each revenue engine.
- API rate limits or access restrictions.
