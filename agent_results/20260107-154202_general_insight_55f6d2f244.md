1) Verdict: Concrete repo actions identified for rapid ROI scan on global markets/news arbitrage engines.

2) Actionable Insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining 3 revenue engines: (1) news arbitrage alerts, (2) global market data scraping, (3) finance intelligence API.
- Add ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to document all automated runs and outcomes.
- Implement scripts in /engines/arbitrage_alerts/ for parsing global news feeds and flagging price anomalies.
- Set up /data/feeds/market_sources.json with prioritized global market and news APIs (Bloomberg, Reuters, Yahoo Finance, etc).
- Build /engines/market_scraper/ for low-effort, continuous data extraction from public finance endpoints.
- Draft /engines/intel_api/README.md specifying endpoints for news/finance intelligence (not just social media).
- Add /tests/arbitrage_alerts/ to validate anomaly detection logic.
- Document all revenue engine assumptions and metrics in agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md.
- Log all automated runs and errors in ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md for auditability.

4) Risks/unknowns:
- API access/costs and licensing for global news/market data.
- Real-time data latency and completeness.
- Regulatory/compliance issues for arbitrage signals.
- Effectiveness of anomaly detection on noisy news data.
- Monetization path for each engine (B2B, SaaS, alerts, etc).
