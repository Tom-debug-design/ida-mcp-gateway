1) Verdict: ROI_SCAN plan requires concrete repo actions for global markets, finance intelligence, and parallel revenue engines.

2) Bullet insights:
- Create agent_results/ROI_PLAN.md outlining three revenue engines: (1) data resale, (2) signal subscription, (3) arbitrage execution.
- Add ops/logs/AUTORUN_LOG.md to track all automated runs and outcomes.
- Implement /engines/arbitrage/ for code scanning global market price feeds and identifying arbitrage.
- Build /engines/news_intel/ for parsing financial news and extracting actionable intelligence.
- Set up /engines/signal_subs/ for generating and distributing trading signals via API.
- Integrate lowest-effort engine (data resale) first, using /engines/data_resale/ to package and list datasets.
- Document all revenue engine logic and data flows in /docs/REVENUE_ENGINES.md.
- Add /configs/markets.yaml to define target markets and data sources.
- Log all arbitrage opportunities and signal performance in /logs/engines/.
- Ensure all code and data paths are versioned and auditable.

4) Risks/unknowns:
- Data source licensing and access for global markets.
- Real-time data latency and reliability.
- Regulatory compliance for arbitrage and signal distribution.
- Market saturation and competition for each revenue engine.
- Technical integration challenges across engines.
